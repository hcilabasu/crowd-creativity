<script id="tutorialWelcomeTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>Welcome to the CrowdMuse system. Here, you can collaboratively generate and organize ideas!</p>

    <p>This very short tutorial will walk you through the core parts of this system.</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialAddIdeaTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>You can add a new idea by clicking this button</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialInspirationTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>Whenever you need some extra inspiration, just click here</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialIdeaViewerTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>This is the idea viewer. Every idea you add (through the "Add Idea" button above) will appear here.</p>

    <p>
        You can add a new idea by clicking the "add idea" button 
        (<img src="{{=URL('static','images/plus-padding.png')}}" alt="See all ideas" class="inline">)
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also open every idea that has been generated by clicking the "See all ideas" 
        button (<img src="{{=URL('static','images/group.png')}}" alt="See all ideas" class="inline">) on the toolbar. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To see only your ideas again, click on "See my ideas" button 
        (<img src="{{=URL('static','images/user.png')}}" alt="See all ideas" class="inline">).
    </p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialSolutionSpaceTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>This is the solution space. Each row and column represents a distinct tag related to the ideas that have been generated.</p>

    <p>The darker the cell, the more ideas have been generated at the intersection between two tags.</p>

    <p>If you hover over a cell, the ideas that belong to the tags you're pointing to will be highlighted in the idea viewer.</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialVersioningViewTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>
        This is the versioning view. It allows you to see where an idea came from: has it been combined or merged from other ideas? 
        What are its older versions?
    </p>
</script>
