<script id="tutorialWelcomeTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>Welcome to the CrowdMuse system. Here, you can collaboratively generate and organize ideas!</p>

    <p>This quick tutorial will walk you through the core parts of this system.</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialMainActionsTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <div class="textAndImages">
        <h3>Adding new ideas</h3>
        <img src='{{=URL('static','images/new-tut.png')}}' class="floatLeft" />
        <p>This is the main way to contribute. Whenever an idea comes up, add it. <strong>Remember: there are no bad ideas in brainstorming!</strong> </p>

        <h3>Refining existing ideas</h3>
        <img src='{{=URL('static','images/refine-tut.png')}}' class="floatLeft" />
        <p>Maybe you bumped into an idea that you were thinking of. Instead of just moving on, you can improve that idea by adding more details, correcting mistakes, etc.</p>

        <h3>Combining two ideas</h3>
        <img src='{{=URL('static','images/combine-tut.png')}}' class="floatLeft" />
        <p>One of the most important parts of brainstorming is building on the ideas of others. CrowdMuse allows you to combine two ideas into a more creative one.</p>

        <p>We'll now show you how to do each one of these.</p>
    </div>
</script>

<script id="tutorialTopicTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>You are supposed to come up with ideas for the following topic:</p>
    
    <p class="tutorialProblemDescription">
        {{=problem.description}}
    </p>

    <p>Try to be as creative as you can and come up with as many ideas as possible!</p>

    <p>You can read this description at any time by clicking the "+" button above.</p>
    
</script>

<script id="tutorialAddIdeaTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>You can add a new idea by clicking this button</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialInspirationTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>Whenever you need some extra inspiration, just click here. We'll chose ideas from other users and show them to you.</p>
    <p>The ideas that were shown to you will appear in the idea workspace, so you can refine or combine them if you want.</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialIdeaViewerTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>This is the idea viewer. Every idea you add (through the "Add Idea" button above) will appear here.</p>

    <p>
        You can add a new idea by clicking the "add idea" button 
        (<img src="{{=URL('static','images/plus-padding.png')}}" alt="See all ideas" class="inline">)
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also open every idea that has been generated by clicking the "See all ideas" 
        button (<img src="{{=URL('static','images/group.png')}}" alt="See all ideas" class="inline">) on the toolbar. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To see only your ideas again, click on "See my ideas" button 
        (<img src="{{=URL('static','images/user.png')}}" alt="See all ideas" class="inline">).
    </p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialSolutionSpaceTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>This is the solution space. Each row and column represents a distinct tag related to the ideas that have been generated.</p>

    <p>The darker the cell, the more ideas have been generated at the intersection between two tags.</p>

    <p>If you hover over a cell, the ideas that belong to the tags you're pointing to will be highlighted in the idea viewer.</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialVersioningViewTemplate" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>
        This is the versioning view. It allows you to see where an idea came from: has it been combined or merged from other ideas? 
        What are its older versions?
    </p>
</script>

<!-- Idea viewer expanded -->
<script id="tutorialExpandedIdeaViewer1Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>
        The idea workspace lets you see the ideas you or others have created. Whenever you add an idea, it shows up in here.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/load-demo-noall.gif')}}" alt="Click on the buttons to load ideas"/>
        You can <strong>load a set of ideas</strong> by clicking one of the buttons on the top left.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/stats.png')}}" alt="The workspace summarizes how many ideas you've added"/>
        It also <strong>shows a summary</strong> of how many original, refined, and combined ideas you have added so far.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>This is where you refine or combine ideas.</strong> We'll show you how to do that now.
    </p>
</script>
<script id="tutorialExpandedIdeaViewer2Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>
        <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/expand-demo.gif')}}" alt="Hover over an idea to expand it"/>
        You can <strong>refine an idea</strong> by hovering your mouse over it and clicking the refine button.
        You can rewrite the idea to add more detail, fix things, or just make it more to your liking.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is to make an idea more useful, improving its quality.
    </p>
</script>
<script id="tutorialExpandedIdeaViewer3Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>
        <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/combine-demo.gif')}}" alt="Drag an idea onto another to combine them"/>
        You can <strong>combine</strong> two ideas by dragging one onto another.
        Combining an idea lets you pick bits from both ideas to create a new, original idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is to create a completely original idea from two others. By as creative as you'd like!
    </p>
</script>

<!-- Versioning view expanded -->
<script id="tutorialExpandedVersioningView1Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>
        In CrowdMuse, you can can do 3 operations with ideas: refine, combine or merge.
    </p>
    <p>
        The history view allows you to keep track of these operations and see how an idea came about.
    </p>
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/history-example.png')}}" alt="The history view"/>
    <p>
        The left-most ideas (with the blue background) are the latest version. Their history is to their right.
    </p>
</script>
<script id="tutorialExpandedVersioningView2Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/combined-example.png')}}" alt="Combined ideas" class="small"/>
    <p>The blue line indicates that the idea on the left is the result of a combination between the ideas on the right</p>
    
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/merged-example.png')}}" alt="Merged ideas" class="small"/>
    <p>The red line indicates that the idea on the left is the result of a merge between the ideas on the right</p>
    
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/refined-example.png')}}" alt="Refined idea" class="small"/>
    <p>The green line indicates that the idea on the left is a refinement of the idea on the right</p>
</script>
<script id="tutorialExpandedVersioningView3Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>You can open an idea in the idea workspace by clicking on it.</p>
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/open-demo.gif')}}" alt="Click to open an idea"/>
    <p>Ideas that are open in the workspace are indicated by a dark dot in their center</p>
</script>

<!-- Solution space expanded -->
<script id="tutorialExpandedSolutionSpace1Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <p>The solution space gives you an overview of all the ideas suggested so far.</p>
    
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/solutionspace-example.png')}}" class="half" alt="The solution space"/>

    <p>The <strong>rows and columns represent all the tags</strong> that have been used so far</p>
    
    <p>The <strong>color of a cell represents the quantity of ideas</strong> that have been suggested at the intersection of the two tags. The darker the cell, the more ideas have been suggested</p>

    <p>In this example, more ideas have been suggested with only the tag "second" than with both tags "second" and "third".</p>
</script>

<script id="tutorialExpandedSolutionSpace2Template" type="text/x-tmpl-mustache">
    <img src="{{=URL('static', 'images/solutionspace-demo.gif')}}" alt="Opening ideas from the solution space"/>

    <p>Clicking on a tag name will open ANY ideas that have used that tag on the workspace.</p>

    <p>Clicking on a cell will open ONLY the ideas that have both tags.</p>
</script>
